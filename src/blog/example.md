Almost three months ago to the day, I signed into Slack for my new agency job.
Now, here I am signing out again, but for the best possible reason.

Having first gotten into the world of public sector digital agencies with the (sadly now defunct) FutureGov, and dipped my toe into the startup world in the interim, I was keen to get back to work that made actual improvements to peoples’ lives.

Since I’d been out of the public sector, the cost of energy, housing and other basic essentials had shot up, and the richest people in the world [doubled their wealth](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/billionaire-wealth-covid-pandemic-12-trillion-jeff-bezos-wealth-tax/).

## Conditions are harder than ever before

It’s hard to live in the UK and not get the feeling that the country is just not working for most people any more.

We can’t rely on a change of government to fix things. Undoing the kind of damage our social infrastructure has seen takes time and a multitude of bottom-up efforts.
In the public sector, local authorities teetering on bankruptcy are commissioning less original work from agencies.

In fact, much of the tech sector is a consequence of the era of cheap money. Now, with the cost of borrowing back up, the leaders of those tech companies are making job cuts and battening down the hatches.

The party isn‘t over yet, but the music is slowing.

## The time is once again right for innovation

When the Government Digital service was founded in 2011, it was just the vanguard of a whole wave of similar organisations, including agencies.

Now, most of those orgs are either gone, or rendered unrecognisable by scale. They went public, went bust, ate their competitors or were themselves eaten.

Business leaders now talk the talk of “customer experience”.

Cory Doctorow likes to say [“every pirate wants to be an admiral”](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2011/may/30/internet-piracy-cory-doctorow).

But the sector is no longer all sewn up.

Twitter’s nose dive in recent weeks, coupled with Facebook’s transparent metaverse cash-grab, feel like portents. The social media pillars felt unassailable for the better part of a decade. Now they’re being abandoned in droves.

People are getting restless for change again.

## A business model that people actually enjoy

When I joined FutureGov, their bread and butter was the small work: three month-ish projects delivered by a cross-functional team of six to eight people.

Sure, there’s limits to this model. You often spend a big chunk of that time just building trust and wrestling out the freedom you need to deliver.

You can’t deliver big hulking change and transformation programmes in three months either. It’s just not possible. Big groups of people are slow to change and always will be.

But there’s also advantages. A diverse income stream, for one.

At their heart, these little bits of work are about experimentation and creativity. We’re keen on “small c” change: if you get the right people together under the right conditions, they can innovate more in a month than a formal change programme can in a year.

Was I just missing the good old days?

Maybe, but it’s come up in conversation more in the past year than all the years before that combined.

More and more people are disillusioned with the state of the sector and wondering what’s next.

## We’re starting a new agency

All this to say, we’re starting a new thing. Agency, studio, collective, network, call it what you want.

We call it **Interrobang**. We thought it was fun, because a question that’s also an exclamation is something we both do quite a lot at work.

We’re not interested in scaling. The sector doesn’t need [yet another big supplier](https://www.tussell.com/insights/uk-government-strategic-suppliers%23Profiles&sa=D) wannabe.

This isn’t “move fast and break things” either. We’re interested in helping communities recover, and building resilience into our social infrastructure. Research, technology and design have massive parts to play in that.

What if we could keep the good parts of Big Tech, but ditch the exploitative business models that came with it?

There’s precedent for this emerging [all around the world](https://drivers.coop).

We won’t repeat the mistakes we’ve seen former employers make. We’ll certainly make new ones.

Both of us are thinking “what’s next?”. We're determined that this not be just another agency. It's something different, but we don't know quite what yet.

If any of this rings true to you, we should chat.

We can’t promise work (yet), but as always, there’s power in numbers.
