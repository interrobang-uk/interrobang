title: Equality, diversity and inclusion
---

Interrobang exists to make our communities more resilient to the interconnected, worsening crises of the coming decades.

Big, systemic problems like climate, housing and social care criss-cross the public, private, charity and voluntary sectors.

No one organisation can fix them, and there is no single fix that works for every community.

So, we want to give people the confidence and skills to pursue their own ideas rather than enforce our own.

A diverse and inclusive team is the most important single thing we can do to make this happen.

We’ve been vocal about these issues in [our newsletter](https://interrobanguk.substack.com).

Interrobang has a 100% queer and non-male founding team, and our core membership of ten people is 90% non-male.

## What we're already doing

To get here, we:

- pay a fair rate to our team members that is well above the market average. When we last benchmarked our margin, it was half that of comparative businesses.

- encourage people to work flexibly and remotely, around family and personal commitments

- fairly compensate research participants for their time, and bring them onto our team as peer researchers whenever practical

- use inclusive recruitment that doesn’t expect things like university degrees from applicants

- became a [Living Wage](https://www.livingwage.org.uk/accredited-living-wage-employers) accredited employer

- became a [Disability Confident](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/disability-confident-campaign) employer

## What we want to do

As we grow, we also want to:

- offer more training, coaching and mentoring on a “pay what you can” basis, with sponsored places for people of marginalised groups

- offer apprenticeships in junior roles on our teams

- conduct equality and diversity surveys twice annually as our membership grows so we can more precisely track how we're doing

- form a [member circle](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/) with particular interest in and responsibility for equality, diversity and inclusion issues.
