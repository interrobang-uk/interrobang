Interrobang is a child of the climate emergency. We’re doing this work because we know the future needs new ideas, not more of the same.

Our mission is to make our communities more resilient to the interconnected crises of the coming decades.

Our team is made up of people who don’t believe we’re doing enough to prepare for the climate crisis.

That belief will be apparent in all our work.

Interrobang already works almost entirely remotely and paperlessly.

## Technology projects

On technology projects, we’ll:

- only use cloud providers with the most favourable net-zero ratings (AWS scores quite badly)

- use caching and edge computing to reduce the cost of transferring data for central processing

- send static, pre-rendered web pages to users’ devices where we can

- avoid making features from scratch where a good third-party service can be integrated with

These approaches are also the best for:

- accessibility, because we minimise computation on the user’s end, which can be tough on slower or older devices

- performance, because doing more closer to the user means there are fewer long round-trips to a distant server

- cost, because reducing unnecessary data transfer and computation reduces cloud bills

We have an attitude of continuous improvement to these issues. If a better provider or technology comes onto the market, we’ll adopt it.
