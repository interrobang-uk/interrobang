We guided the panels to make prototypes of how the services could look and work.\n\nIt’s unethical to bring traditional research methods like A/B testing to this kind of high-risk intervention into people’s lives. Doing trauma-informed co-design with peer experts meant we could reduce the likelihood of harm and get deeper insights into how the service should work.\n\nSamaritans is a federated organisation: each branch is an independent charity with its own priorities and ways of working. They are experts on their local area, but this makes it more difficult to provide new services in a consistent, joined-up way.\n\nWe addressed this by running a closed pilot in a small geographic area where we could work closer with the branches involved, giving a small number of users an option to opt into the trial from the Samaritans website.\n\n[Self-help is now a core part](https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/self-help/) of what Samaritans do, and they are gradually bringing the [webchat service](https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/chat-online/) to more groups of people.\n",

This involved:\n- researching, designing and building new digital services for residents, including applying for temporary accommodation and reporting repairs\n- researching, designing and building new staff-facing case management tools to more effectively administer their services\n- forming a new technology strategy reliant on open source software and standards-compliant APIs rather than expensive supplier contracts\n- providing strategic consultancy services to help Hackney reorganise their teams around user needs rather than business needs\n- engaging the entire housing system beyond the council with workshops and research interviews, including landlords, residents and housing associations\n- \nHackney’s digital housing services are now acknowledged as some of the best in the country.\n",

She captured a range of data to inform our work including case management notes, outcomes data, systems mapping, and speaking to people we supported.\n\nSarah conducted interviews and focus groups with people experiencing multiple disadvantage who were or had been experiencing hardship and difficulty getting the support they needed; it was essential that we heard directly from people with lived experience. \n\nThis gave us a comprehensive understanding of their journeys and the barriers and challenges that they faced, which gave insight into what could improve their journey through the system. It was essential that this work was carried out in a sensitive, trauma-informed way and we used participatory methods to ensure that participants felt in control of their own narrative. \n\nShe undertook training in trauma, gender and culturally informed approaches that she applies in all of her work. Interviews took place on the phone, in-person and on Zoom and had to be delivered in an accessible and adaptable way to respond to individual circumstances and needs.\n\nThrough capturing this information, we were able to identify core barriers within the local system, for example, women were struggling to access drug and alcohol support in one particular borough. We were then able to advocate for these women and liaise with the local drug service, which led to a mixed group of service users and staff at the service coming together to co-design improvements to the service to enable women to access the drug and alcohol support they needed.\n\n",

This would be achieved by helping support buyers find, assess and purchase solutions which will have been verified to meet a set of standards.  \n\n## Project impact\nOur research outputs were translated into a set of functional requirements to inform the scope and assessment criteria for the DPS. As well as provide further insight into the needs of users, the challenges & opportunities faced across the sector in adopting and using digital social care records.\n\n## Our learnings\nWe developed an understanding of systemic barriers to adopting digital for care providers as well as insights into the specific user needs for functionality. Including:\n- An understanding that **existing digital products in the market are often too broad** to serve the specific and contextual needs of care providers and can therefore slow down the adoption of such tools as cash-strapped and time-poor services have to customise and embed them. \n- The realisation that there are **minimal incentives for care providers to use digital tools** in the first place, due to anxieties around tech adoption and lack of time/resource to learn/embed new ways of working. \n- An understanding of the requirement for all DSCRs to incorporate:\n    - The ability to record care interventions at the **point of delivering care**, with minimum extra burden to the care worker or recipient.\n    - **Accessibility and digital inclusivity** into all product design decisions, to support easy and intuitive use of the tool, suitable for the full range of accessibility and language needs. \n    - **Assessment and goal-setting tools** that feature the logging of holistic elements like the care recipient’s mood and daily activities, to support people to live a full and holistic life.\nThe ability to **share care records** easily and safely with other care providers to support holistic treatment and stop the care recipient having to repeat their story.\n",

We incorporated their feedback, suggestions, and lived experiences to ensure that the service was accessible, intuitive, and met their specific needs.\n\nThroughout the project, we embraced an iterative approach, continuously refining and adapting our solutions based on user feedback and emerging insights. By adopting this iterative process, we ensured that the service and communication strategy were responsive to the evolving needs of the target audience, allowing for ongoing improvement and optimization.\n\nBy combining qualitative research, collaborative engagement with stakeholders, and an iterative design approach, we were able to create a tailored service and communication strategy that directly addressed the challenges faced by individuals without a fixed address. Our commitment to understanding the unique circumstances and perspectives of this vulnerable group allowed us to deliver a solution that was empathetic, effective, and responsive to their needs.\n\n\n",

The old website was caked in ads. Rather than accepting this as a “requirement”, we found that it cost the same to administer the ads as the revenue they made, so we convinced BFI to scrap them for a saner user experience.\n\nBFI offers support to film students and educators. People struggled to understand what they could get and how to apply for it. We prioritised these services by popularity and ran research with the teams providing them to explain them in a simpler way and truncate the application processes.\n\nWe wanted to galvanise BFI into adopting a new user-centric mentality. We went beyond the ‘usual suspects’, engaging IT, accountants, lawyers and policymakers, using the project as a wedge to transform teams and processes to fit modern expectations.\n\nBFI wanted to model accessibility from day one, so we avoided a top-down “creative direction” approach, and let these elements emerge organically from meeting user needs. In the end, we tested a minimal, elegant visual brand that lets films speak for themselves.\n\nTo de-risk the project, we used the London Film Festival (#LFF) as a pilot.

Over the 12 weeks of the project, we iterated quickly, testing and changing 4 times. We usability tested with those with additional needs, taking special care to make sure the interface was usable with a screen reader, friendly for those who are colour-blind.\n\nAs a result of our work, the Home Office data teams are now able to quickly create, understand and distribute data reports around very sensitive, or high profile data.

This meant that courts had to reconvene in order to rewatch the evidence, leading to unnecessary costs and delays, while also adding strain to already time-constrained court proceedings.\n\nTo tackle this issue, our team embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the pain points experienced by court clerks, judges, and juries throughout the process. By actively engaging with these stakeholders and conducting journey mapping exercises, we gained valuable insights into the most challenging aspects of the existing procedures. It became clear that juries needed a method to deliberate upon evidence independently, allowing them to control which sections they reviewed and when. Simultaneously, court clerks required a streamlined process that minimised additional administrative burden.\n\nIn response, we put forth a groundbreaking solution that involves live recording of courtroom evidence and the utilisation of microSD cards and USB sticks. This approach empowers juries with the autonomy to revisit and analyse evidence within the dedicated jury rooms. By providing the necessary tools for independent review, our solution alleviates the strain on courts and ensures a more efficient use of resources.\n\nOverall, our model revolutionised the way multimedia evidence is handled in courtrooms, bringing about enhanced efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reduced time pressure for all parties involved.\n",

This inclusive approach allowed us to gain deep insights into the pressing issues faced by the community, as well as identify areas where Empowering Local’s interventions had the greatest impact. \n\nAnother critical aspect of our work was building community resilience. We recognised that communities are stronger when they come together, supporting and uplifting one another. Through our initiatives, we fostered a sense of belonging, encouraged community collaboration, and provided resources that help communities thrive in the face of challenges.\n\nWe provided recommendations in three main areas; laying the groundwork, design and delivery and sustainability and embedding.

Reeling from recent redundancies and with the unit’s reputation suffering, we discovered a crisis of confidence and a lack of new ideas from stakeholders at all levels.\n\nWe turned to external experts from the public, private and third sectors: speaking to public intellectuals, writers, community leaders, artists, investors and innovators. With a time frame of 2033 in mind, we synthesised the common themes of these conversations and used them to generate new concepts to test.\n\nWe then prototyped these future-facing concepts with a variety of means, from flashcards to clickable prototypes, to working software. We then used them as provocations in several more rounds of research with stakeholders, citizens and external experts. We focused not only on individual attitudes but on the community and society-level consequences of these interventions, both positive and negative.\n\nWe packaged these concepts into a user-centric narrative with a mix of storytelling methods, including journey mapping, storyboarding and new techniques we invented for the project. \n\nWe provided template business cases and policy documents to allow the client to hit the ground running with implementation. We involved stakeholders in our day-to-day work, as part of our blended team, and had them deliver our milestone show-and-tells so that the ideas were felt to have come from within. The client is now converting this vision into their official strategy.\n\n\n",

We were accountable for the strategic planning and execution of our work, as well as the operation delivery to support it. \n\nWorking with the Mayor, Chief Digital Officer and digital teams in 8 EU capital cities, alongside a range of international partners such as Harvard University and the Centre for Public Impact, we led the transformation of culture, ways of working and technology across a range of service areas, including health, social care, housing and planning. \n\nOne example of this is the project to design and implement a new city-level employment service in Helsinki, Finland. Between 2020 and 2022, Helsinki was one of 8 cities in Finland selected to take part in ‘The Experiment’, the transfer of national employment services to a municipal level in an attempt to provide more person-centred support and reduce unemployment. We designed and tested 3 prototypes across onboarding to the new service, communication with service users, and digital tools to support front-line staff.\n\nThrough a mixture of ways of working, technology and content design we designed a new service which was more centred around the hopes and aspirations of job seekers than the box-ticking of administrators who focused on quantity over quality. This resulted in a 10% increase in completed employment plans during the beta phase of our work. This was a good indicator for clients being matched with more appropriate roles, as well as enabling employment specialists to prioritise clients more effectively. \n## \n\n\n",

        "Longer description": "From 2021, colleagues helped Hackney Council’s social care service recover from a devastating cyber attack. Vital case management software was taken offline, and all production data was encrypted and held for ransom.\n\nHackney was using old legacy technology, and restoring it was a years-long process. So, we worked to decrypt the lost data at the same time as building a new suite of modern, collaborative tools for social workers.\n\nOur approach was fast, nimble and agile, designing and building product features in days that would normally take weeks or months. We worked under incredible uncertainty in a risk-averse environment to deliver an ambitious collection of tools that improved on what came before, rather than just reproducing it.\nWe took inspiration from other sectors and introduced product design patterns that were novel to social care, such as the kanban board interface common to tools like Trello and Jira.\n\nWe also saw this as an opportunity to deliver bottom-up, “small c” change in the social care service itself. Our service design approach used a “trojan mouse” philosophy: often teams have their hands tied by old legacy software, so by breaking that constraint we can encourage new ways of working without the expense and inertia of a large, formal change programme.\n\nFor months, Hackney’s strategy had been purely to restore their original compromised systems, but the speed and quality of our work encouraged them to see the cyber-attack as a once-in-a-generation chance to bring real, transformative improvements to social care practice.\n",

A summary of the key legislation and guidance is available from [NSPCC](http://nspcc.org.uk/childprotection).\n\nWe recognise that: \n- the welfare of children, young people and vulnerable adults is paramount in all the work we do and in all the decisions we take \n- working in partnership with children, young people, their parents, carers and other agencies is essential in promoting young people’s welfare \n- all children, regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation have an equal right to protection from all types of harm or abuse \n- some children are additionally vulnerable because of the impact of previous experiences, their level of dependency, communication needs or other issues \n- extra safeguards may be needed to keep children who are additionally vulnerable safe from abuse.\n\nWe will seek to keep children and young people safe by: \n- DBS checking all of our research staff\n- valuing, listening to and respecting them \n- appointing a nominated child protection lead for children and young people (Chloe Coleman) and a deputy (Ashley O’Callaghan)\n- adopting child protection and safeguarding best practice through our policies, procedures and code of conduct for staff and volunteers \n- developing and implementing an effective online safety policy and related procedures \n- providing effective management for staff and volunteers through supervision, support, training and quality assurance measures so that all staff and volunteers know about and follow our policies, procedures and behaviour codes confidently and competently\n- recruiting and selecting staff and volunteers safely, ensuring all necessary checks are made\n- recording and storing and using information professionally and securely, in line with data protection legislation and guidance [more information about this is available from the Information Commissioner’s Office: ico.org.uk/fororganisations] \n- sharing information about safeguarding and good practice with children and their families via leaflets, posters, group work and one-to-one discussions \n- making sure that children, young people and their families know where to go for help if they have a concern  \n- using our safeguarding and child protection procedures to share concerns and relevant information with agencies who need to know, and involving children, young people, parents, families and carers appropriately \n- using our procedures to manage any allegations against staff and volunteers appropriately \n- creating and maintaining an anti-bullying environment and ensuring that we have a policy and procedure to help us deal effectively with any bullying that does arise \n- ensuring that we have effective complaints and whistleblowing measures in place \n- ensuring that we provide a safe physical environment for our children, young people, staff and volunteers, by applying health and safety measures in accordance with the law and regulatory guidance \n- building a safeguarding culture where staff and volunteers, children, young people and their families, treat each other with respect and are comfortable about sharing concerns.\n",

This policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with  integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and  controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere within our company. \n\n**Due diligence **\n\nWe consider ourselves to be a ‘low risk’ business with regard to slavery and human trafficking.  However, we foster a culture that encourages the identification and reporting of any such risks within  our business. We do not recruit from outside the UK  or use agency workers. \n\n**Assessing and managing risk **\n\nWe have a whistleblowing policy in place and, as part of our efforts to identify and mitigate risks within our company. \n\n**Effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafficking **\n\nWe have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure that all those in our supply  chains comply with our values we are putting in place a supply chain compliance programme that will  require our suppliers to confirm that they have a slavery and human trafficking policy in place and that  they require the same from their suppliers. \n\n\n",

        "Content": "If you hire us and we don't provide a specific agreement for you to sign, then these terms are the ones that will apply:\n\n## Regarding digital products and services\nWe’ll create responsive designs which adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. To give you a better understanding of our designs, we’ll use Figma or a similar design tool. Sometimes, we’ll use visuals to indicate a creative direction (colour, texture and typography.)\n\nYou’ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. We’ll share a Google Drive folder, Github repository or a development site with you. We’ll have regular, possibly daily, contact by email, phone, Slack, or Google Meet.\n\nIf, at any stage, you change your mind about our deliverables or aren’t happy with our work, you’ll pay us in full for the time we’ve spent working with you. Then, we agree to terminate this contract.\n\n### Written content\nUnless agreed separately, we’re not responsible for uploading text or images to your website or creating every page. We provide professional copywriting and editing services, so if you’d like us to create, edit, or input content for you, we’ll provide a separate estimate.\n\n### Graphics and photographs\nYou will supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format including Adobe Illustrator (.ai) or .svg. You will provide high resolution digital photographs. If your design requires stock images, these assets—and the time we spend selecting them—aren’t included in our price. We can provide a separate estimate for stock images and research.\n\n### Changes and revisions\nWe won’t limit your ability to change your mind. Our price is based on the number of days we estimate are needed to deliver everything we’ve agreed to achieve. If you change your mind, adding extra work won’t be a problem and we’re happy to be flexible. We’ll provide a separate estimate for any additional work.\n\n### Testing\nYou understand that browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. You agree it does mean ensuring someone’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of their browser or device.\n\nWe will test our work only in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla (Firefox.) We won’t test in older versions unless agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser or specific device, we will provide a separate estimate for that. We will test your design using the latest versions of:\n- iOS: Safari on iPhone and iPad\n- Android: Google Chrome\n\nWe won’t test specific Android devices, or other mobile browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need us to test using alternative devices, we will provide a separate estimate.\n\n### Search engine optimisation (SEO)\nYou understand we don’t guarantee improvements to your search engine ranking, but that the websites we develop are accessible to search engines.\n\n### Hosting\nWe’re not a hosting company—so we don’t offer support for website hosting, email, or other technical services. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don’t already have hosting, we’ll recommend a provider and ask you to set up an account.\n\n## Liability\nWe carry out work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from qualified people with relevant experience.\n\nThat said, we can’t guarantee our work will be free from errors. We won’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them.\n\nIn return, your liability to us will be limited only to the price stated in this contract. You won’t be liable to us or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.\n\nFinally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\n\n## Intellectual property rights\nYou guarantee the written content you provide is original, or that you have the rights to use it.\n\nYou also guarantee you have licences to use images which are owned by photographers or have been purchased from stock libraries.\n\nYou agree to protect us from any claim by owners of copyrighted material. When our work requires licensed fonts or images from stock libraries, we’ll ask you to purchase them so you’ll be licensed to use them.\n\nIn return, we guarantee our work is original. When you’ve paid us in full—and if this contract hasn’t been terminated—we’ll assign intellectual property rights to you as follows:\n\nYou’ll own the graphic files and any other artefacts we produce during your project. We’ll give you permission to use these files for any purpose.\n## Working in the open\nWe reserve the right to display any aspect of our work as long as doing so doesn’t breach any separate confidentiality agreement. This may include sketches, work-in-progress designs and the finished project on our newsletter, website, in magazine articles, or in books.\n\nWe may want to do this while our project is still ongoing. We’ll always discuss this with you first to make sure that we protect your confidentiality.\n\n## Payment schedule\nYou understand how important it is for a small business that you pay your bills promptly. We’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, so you agree to stick tightly to the following payment schedule:\n\nWe’ll invoice you every month, in arrears for all hours worked that month. Our payment terms are 30 days from the date of invoice. We issue invoices electronically and our bank account details will be included. Our invoices will be in GBP. If your currency is different, you agree your payments will be the same value.\n\nYou agree to pay all charges associated with international transfers of funds. We reserve the right to charge you interest on all overdue debts.\n\n## Small print\nNeither of us can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.\n\nWe both agree to adhere to laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not to cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.\n\nThis contract stays in place and need not be renewed. Although its language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of English and Welsh courts.\n\nAlthough the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of English and Welsh courts.\n\n## To sum up\nYou have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give us the assets and information we need to complete the project. You’ll do this when we ask and provide the formats we ask for. You’ll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule earlier in this contract.\n\nWe have the experience and ability to deliver everything we’ve agreed with you and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll try to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we’ll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.\n",

We run this website and any subdomains.\n\nWe are [Cyber Essentials](https://iasme.co.uk/cyber-essentials/ncsc-certificate-search/) certified.\n\nThis page was last updated on 1 July 2023.\n## \n## Our website\nWe don't collect any analytics from this website. That includes cookies, which is why you didn't have to click through a cookie banner when you landed on this site.\n\n## Our newsletter and social media\nOur newsletter is hosted on [Substack](https://substack.com) ([privacy policy](https://substack.com/privacy)), and we also use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) ([privacy policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy)).\n\nWe sometimes use Substack and LinkedIn's analytics to understand how we can reach more people.\n\nIf you’d like content about you removed from our newsletter or social media, contact **data@interrobang.coop**.\n\n## Research participants\nOur work involves researching with vulnerable people about difficult topics. Part of how we protect them is treating their data with care.\n\nWe collect the following information from research participants:\n\n- Full name\n- Phone number\n- Email address\n- Address\n\n### Consent forms\n- Full name\n- Signature\n\n### Research material\n- Interview recordings (audio or video)\n- Quotes and transcripts\n- Notes\n- Photos\n\n### Why we collect this data\nWe collect participant information to identify participants, and arrange sessions and follow-ups.\n\nAll research participants are given a consent form that outlines what the research involves, what information will be recorded and how it will be used. If the participant is happy to proceed we ask them to sign the form to confirm this.\n\nWe collect research material to reference during project work.\n\n### How long we keep research data\nParticipant information is deleted at the end of the project.\n\nWe scan signed consent forms and shred paper copies, then store consent forms on Google Drive and keep these for six years. All notes and digital files are destroyed or deleted two years after the research session. We delete any personal information provided to us from the research recruiter when the project has finished.\n\n### Where research data is processed and stored\nResearch material is separated from any identifiable information, such as consent forms, while we are working with it.\n\nWe use Google Drive to track participants with no identifying information (eg. 'participant 1'), unless consent has been given. Any notes we gather during research sessions are stored securely. Any digital files (like audio, photos and videos) are stored on Google Drive and are only accessed by members involved in the research.\n\nWe may send audio of the research session to a transcriber if necessary. We review the privacy notices of the companies we use for this and ask for explicit consent from participants in our consent forms.\n\nWe may use research materials like quotes, photos, audio or video clips, in presentations to clients. We will only do this if we have consent from participants. We don’t connect this information to participants’ names.\n\nSometimes we may publish quotes from research sessions. We only do this if we have specific consent from the participant and any personally identifiable information has been removed. We will only publish audio, photos and video from a research session if a participant has given consent and has signed a model release form.\n\n### Opt-out of collection\nParticipants can withdraw their information from a project at any time.
